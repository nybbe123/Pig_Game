# PIG GAME
### About
A mini project I made during an online javaScript course Im doing on my spare time. the game is about rolling a dice and collecting points. The one who reaches a total score of 100 points first wins. If a player dice the number 1, the current scores are lost and it is then the next player's turn. If a player wants to save their current score to the total score this is possible but then it is the next players turn to hit the dice.
